// This file extends wasi.go's WASI 0.2 host surface with a genuine
// wasi:filesystem/types + wasi:io/streams input-stream implementation,
// backed by the mounts WASIConfig.FS (a wazy.FSConfig -- the same one the
// core wasi_snapshot_preview1 runtime takes) configures, plus the three
// wasi:cli/terminal-{stdin,stdout,stderr} funcs a real rustc guest's
// std::fs path also reaches (all three always answer "no terminal" -- see
// wasiGetTerminalSig's doc).
//
// # Mounts
//
// Every FSConfig mount becomes one preopened descriptor, reported under its
// guest path by preopens.get-directories; a descriptor records which mount's
// sys.FS it came from and its path within that mount, and every *-at method
// resolves against those two (see fsDescNode). Since a guest resolves an
// absolute path to the longest matching preopen itself -- the same logic it
// applies to preview1's fd preopens -- mounting "/", "/tmp", and
// "/site-packages" separately needs no routing on this side. The two
// operations that span descriptors, rename-at and link-at, are the only ones
// that must care, and they answer cross-device when the two descriptors turn
// out to belong to different mounts, exactly as rename(2) does.
//
// Nothing about a file lives in this package: reads, writes, listings, and
// metadata all go straight to the mounted sys.FS, so a WithDirMount guest
// write is on disk when the call returns, and a read-only mount
// (WithReadOnlyDirMount, or any WithFSMount -- io/fs.FS has no write
// surface) rejects a write with its own errno, translated by fsErrorCode.
//
// # Discovery
//
// Instantiating testdata/real_readfile.component.wasm (a genuine rustc
// wasm32-wasip2 guest whose main is
// `print!("{}", std::fs::read_to_string("/greeting.txt").unwrap())`) with
// wasi.go's WithWASI alone -- get-directories always returning an empty
// list -- and calling run() surfaces Rust's own error, not a wazy trap
// stub: std::sys::pal::wasi's path-to-preopen resolution walks
// get-directories' result looking for a preopened directory whose name is a
// prefix of "/greeting.txt", finds none, and the guest itself panics
// ("failed to find a pre-opened file descriptor ..."), aborting via the
// adapter's unreachable trap before ever reaching a WASI import this
// package doesn't implement. So get-directories must return a real
// preopened root descriptor for the guest to make it any further; once it
// does, re-running names the next unimplemented call in turn. The
// funcs below were discovered exactly that way, one trap at a time; the
// final ordered set std::fs::read_to_string("/greeting.txt") reaches on a
// non-empty get-directories result is:
//
//   - wasi:filesystem/preopens.get-directories (wasi.go's WithWASI slot,
//     rewired here to return one real root descriptor instead of empty)
//   - wasi:filesystem/types.filesystem-error-code
//   - wasi:filesystem/types [method]descriptor.open-at
//   - wasi:filesystem/types [method]descriptor.get-type
//   - wasi:filesystem/types [method]descriptor.stat
//   - wasi:filesystem/types [method]descriptor.metadata-hash (reached via
//     the preview1-to-preview2 adapter's fd_filestat_get, which combines
//     stat + metadata-hash into a full POSIX fstat result -- not called
//     directly by anything in std::fs::read_to_string's own source)
//   - wasi:filesystem/types [method]descriptor.read-via-stream
//   - wasi:io/streams [method]input-stream.blocking-read
//   - wasi:io/streams [method]input-stream.read
//   - wasi:cli/terminal-stdin.get-terminal-stdin
//   - wasi:cli/terminal-stdout.get-terminal-stdout
//   - wasi:cli/terminal-stderr.get-terminal-stderr
//
// (write-via-stream and append-via-stream were, at that point, declared
// imports left to the graph engine's automatic trap-stub fallback --
// read_to_string's read-only path never calls them. The write path,
// discovered the same way against testdata/real_transform.component.wasm
// (`std::fs::write("/output.txt", s.to_uppercase())`), reaches exactly one
// additional descriptor method beyond the read list above:
// [method]descriptor.write-via-stream, followed by
// [method]output-stream.write against the own<output-stream> it returns
// (registered in wasi.go, alongside stdout/stderr's, since output-stream is
// one shared resource/handle namespace across stdio and filesystem writers
// -- see wasi.go's writeSink dispatch). append-via-stream is never actually
// invoked by this fixture -- std::fs::write opens with O_CREAT|O_TRUNC,
// never O_APPEND -- but this package still registers a real implementation
// for it below (sharing write-via-stream's own [method]output-stream.write
// path once minted, differing only in the stream's starting offset), rather
// than leaving a func this close to write-via-stream's own semantics as a
// landmine for the next guest that does call it.)
//
// A later fixture (testdata/conformance/f17_multifs.component.wasm, see
// conformance_test.go), whose main calls std::fs::metadata directly (not
// via read_to_string), surfaced one more func this same discovery process
// hadn't hit yet: [method]descriptor.stat-at. std::sys::fs::metadata on
// wasip2 goes through the preview1-to-preview2 adapter's
// path_filestat_get, which is stat-at (look a path up under a directory
// descriptor without opening it), not stat (fstat an already-open
// descriptor) -- read_to_string never calls metadata itself, so nothing in
// the original discovery list had exercised this path before.
//
// # Batch 4: directories, seek, and unlink
//
// f07/f08/f17's fixtures (and the read/write funcs above) only ever
// open-at + read/write-via-stream one flat file at a time -- nothing
// through f28_itertools ever asks this package to enumerate a directory's
// children, open a *directory* descriptor at all, or remove a path. Seven
// more conformance fixtures (f29_readdir through f35_remove --
// conformance_test.go) close that gap, discovered the same one-trap-at-a-
// time way as the original list above:
//
//   - std::fs::read_dir("/") (f29_readdir) opens "." *first*, not "/" --
//     its first host call is open-at(root, path=".", open-flags=directory),
//     not read-directory directly. Without wasiJoinFSPath treating rel=="."
//     as naming the directory itself, this resolves to a bogus path and the
//     guest panics on a spurious error-code::no-entry before read-directory
//     is ever reached.
//   - [method]descriptor.read-directory -> result<own<directory-entry-
//     stream>, error-code>, then repeated
//     [method]directory-entry-stream.read-directory-entry() ->
//     result<option<directory-entry{type, name}>, error-code> calls until
//     none, is std's actual iterator protocol over a directory (not one
//     batch list<T> call) -- mirrors read-via-stream's own
//     mint-a-resource-then-pull-from-it shape.
//   - [method]descriptor.unlink-file-at(path) (f35_remove) is
//     std::fs::remove_file's host call.
//   - Nothing new was needed for f31_seek (std::io::Seek is implemented
//     entirely in terms of repeated read-via-stream(offset) calls against
//     the same open descriptor -- no distinct "seek" WASI func exists) or
//     f34_append (append-via-stream/stat, both already implemented for
//     f08_filewrite/f17_multifs, are sufficient) -- both fixtures are
//     included anyway because nothing before batch 4 exercised that
//     *combination* (seek positions spanning start/current/end; a
//     stat-after-append/stat-after-truncate size sequence) even though no
//     new host func resulted.
//
// ## Directory modeling
//
// There is none: a directory is whatever the mounted sys.FS says is one.
// This replaced a flat map<string, []byte> of files in which directories
// were *synthetic* -- inferred from the path prefixes of the files under
// them, so an empty directory could not be represented at all, create_dir
// needed a second side table to fake one, and rename of a directory meant
// re-keying every entry beneath it by hand. Mkdir/Rmdir/Rename/Unlink/
// Readdir on the mount do all of that correctly and for free.
//
// # Batch 5: descriptor flags and sync
//
// A real CPython (componentize-py) guest -- the first guest here that is not
// a rustc binary -- reaches two descriptor methods no rustc fixture ever
// did, both through the preview1-to-preview2 adapter rather than from
// Python source directly:
//
//   - [method]descriptor.get-flags, the adapter's fd_fdstat_get: "was this
//     descriptor opened for reading, for writing, or both, and may its
//     contents be mutated?". The read/write answer comes from what open-at
//     recorded on the descriptor, never from the mount; mutate-directory is
//     advertised for every directory, mirroring the dirRightsBase posture
//     wazy's own preview1 fd_fdstat_get already takes -- see getFlags.
//   - [method]descriptor.sync, the adapter's fd_sync, which is os.fsync --
//     pip calls it on every file it writes while installing a wheel. Its
//     sibling [method]descriptor.sync-data (fd_datasync, os.fdatasync) is
//     registered alongside it, sharing one implementation; see fsSyncFunc
//     for both, and for what syncing means when a descriptor holds no
//     cached fd.
//
// # Nested own<T> handles
//
// Every func below whose result nests an own<T> inside a result<>/list<>
// (open-at's result<descriptor,error-code>, read-via-stream's
// result<input-stream,error-code>, get-directories' rewritten
// list<tuple<own<descriptor>,string>>) must mint that handle itself via
// resources.NewOwn: host_import.go's generic lift/lower
// (allocHandleResult/resolveHandleArg) only resolves an own<T>/borrow<T>
// at a func's *top level* (see withResourcesHook's doc in host_import.go),
// not inside a nested composite. wasiFS.resources, set once via
// withResourcesHook right after the Instance's handle table exists (before
// any host func can run), is how these closures -- built once per WithWASI
// call, before any Instance/component.HandleTable exists -- get access to it. A
// borrow<descriptor>/borrow<input-stream> `self` argument, by contrast, IS
// always a func's sole top-level first param, so liftHostArgs already
// resolves it to a rep before these closures ever see it.

// call, so method (the WIT name, for error text) and syncFile are the whole
// difference between them.
//
// # Syncing without a cached fd
//
// A descriptor here holds no open sys.File (see fsDescNode), so this opens
// the path, syncs, and closes -- fsyncing a handle opened moments ago, which
// reads odd until you notice what fsync(2) actually names: the FILE, not the
// descriptor. It flushes the inode's dirty pages and metadata, state shared
// by every descriptor open on it, which is why fsync through a freshly
// opened handle is indistinguishable from fsync through one held since the
// guest's own open. Nothing is lost by not caching, either: this package
// buffers no writes of its own (writeStreamWrite Pwrites straight to the
// mount, see its doc), so a cached fd would have nothing extra to give the
// kernel. That leaves caching purely a cost -- a host file handle per live
// descriptor, leaked whenever a guest drops a handle without saying so or
// aborts mid-call, which is the exact failure fsDescNode's no-open-file rule
// exists to prevent. So: no cached fd, and no correctness debt from it.
//
// # What each kind of descriptor syncs
//
//   - A directory syncs for real, opened O_RDONLY|O_DIRECTORY. fsync on a
//     directory fd is what makes a create/unlink/rename durable, so no-oping
//     it would quietly break the one guest that does the right thing. (A
//     read-only mount answers bad-descriptor here, since wazy's read-only
//     layer has no sync surface at all -- the same answer wazy's own
//     preview1 fd_sync gives for that mount, so the two runtimes agree.)
//   - A file opened for writing syncs for real, in the access mode it was
//     opened with (mirroring openAt's own O_RDWR/O_WRONLY choice) -- the
//     case pip's os.fsync after writing a wheel's files actually hits.
//   - A file NOT opened for writing answers Ok without touching the mount:
//     types.wit says so outright ("This function succeeds with no effect if
//     the file descriptor is not opened for writing"), and it is the only
//     answer that is the same everywhere -- POSIX fsync(2) on a read-only fd
//     is a successful no-op, but Windows' FlushFileBuffers refuses a handle
//     without write access, so honoring the call literally would make one
//     guest's os.fsync succeed on Linux and fail on Windows for no reason

// holding one for a subdirectory must not be able to walk up out of it --
// not to the preopen root, and certainly not off the mount and into the
// host filesystem. The WASI testsuite's interesting_paths cases are what
// pinned that behavior for preview1; the check here is deliberately
// identical so the two runtimes cannot disagree about what a guest may
// reach.
//
// This is unconditional: there is no mount option, config field, or build
// tag that turns it off, and adding one was considered and rejected. The
// component model never asks for it -- wasi:filesystem has no method or
// flag that means "leave this directory", and a descriptor obtained from
// preopens.get-directories is the only way a guest can name anything at
// all, so escape is not a capability being withheld, it is one that was
// never granted. Every guest this package runs (the conformance fixtures,

	// Python's os.fstat/io mode checks, and of every std that asks "was
	// this opened for reading, for writing, or both?".
	//
	// The answer is read straight off the descriptor node, with no call to
	// the mount: descriptor-flags describes how the descriptor was OPENED
	// (the access mode open-at's `flags` argument resolved to), not what the
	// underlying path would permit -- the same distinction fcntl(fd,
	// F_GETFL) draws, and the reason a descriptor opened read-only on a
	// writable file must still report only `read`. That also means this func
	// has no error branch of its own: an unknown rep is the shared fail-loud
	// descNode error, and everything else is Ok.
	//
	// mutate-directory is reported for every directory descriptor, and for
	// no other kind -- the flag is directory-scoped by definition (it
	// governs create-directory-at/unlink-file-at/rename-at/link-at, all of
	// which take a directory as self), so a regular-file descriptor
	// carrying it would be meaningless.
	//
	// Crucially it is reported whatever mount the directory came from,
	// including one that will refuse every mutation. A capability flag is
	// advisory, not a guarantee of outcome: `write` on a file descriptor
	// does not promise the next write beats ENOSPC either, and nobody reads
	// it that way. wazy's own preview1 says exactly this already --
	// fd_fdstat_get advertises dirRightsBase (RIGHT_PATH_CREATE_FILE,
	// RIGHT_PATH_UNLINK_FILE, RIGHT_PATH_RENAME_SOURCE/TARGET, ...) for
	// every directory descriptor unconditionally, WithReadOnlyDirMount or
	// not, and lets the real operation return the real errno
	// (imports/wasi_snapshot_preview1/fs.go's dirRightsBase). Since
	// mutate-directory is WASI 0.2's successor to those rights, withholding
	// it here would make wazy's two runtimes disagree about the same mount.
	//
	// The failure modes are not symmetric either. Reported on a read-only
	// mount, a guest tries and gets error-code::read-only or ::unsupported
	// from the operation itself: an errno it can print. Withheld, a guest
	// that gates on the flag never calls at all, and the mount looks
	// read-only with no errno anywhere to explain why -- and a guest gating
	// on it is the concrete case here, since the preview1-to-preview2
	// adapter synthesizes preview1 rights from this func's result, so a
	// missing mutate-directory can become a missing RIGHT_PATH_CREATE_FILE
	// and an ENOTCAPABLE raised inside the guest, before any host call.
	//
