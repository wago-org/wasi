// This file extends wasi.go/wasi_fs.go's WASI 0.2 host surface with a real
// wasi:sockets TCP, UDP, name-resolution, and option implementation backed by Go
// net.Conns -- see WASIConfig.AllowTCP/Dialer's doc for how a caller opts in.
//
// # Discovery
//
// Instantiating testdata/real_tcp.component.wasm (a genuine rustc
// wasm32-wasip2 guest built from `std::net::TcpStream::connect(addr)` +
// write_all + read_to_end + print -- std::net DOES work end-to-end against
// wasip2's wasi:sockets, confirmed by running the same .wasm under a real
// `wasmtime run -S inherit-network` against a scratch Go TCP server before
// any of this file existed) and inspecting Instance.WASICalls() without a
// real implementation registered shows every WASI interface the guest's
// compiled glue declares an import for, in declaration order -- not
// necessarily every one it actually calls at runtime. The funcs this file
// registers are exactly the ones a real connect+write+read_to_end+print
// run reaches:
//
//   - wasi:sockets/instance-network.instance-network -> own<network> (a
//     single, stateless singleton handle -- see wasiNetworkRep's doc)
//   - wasi:sockets/tcp-create-socket.create-tcp-socket
//   - wasi:sockets/tcp [method]tcp-socket.{start-connect,finish-connect,
//     subscribe}
//   - wasi:io/poll [method]pollable.block, and the free poll() func (WIT-
//     complete even though this particular guest binary's compiled glue
//     never actually calls the list-based free func at runtime -- it awaits
//     exactly one pollable at a time via [method]pollable.block instead --
//     matching this package's existing practice of registering a real,
//     WIT-correct impl for a func immediately adjacent to ones a fixture
//     does reach, e.g. wasi_fs.go's append-via-stream)
//   - wasi:io/streams [method]input-stream.subscribe,
//     [method]output-stream.subscribe (a tcp-socket's connect pollable and
//     an input/output-stream's data-ready pollable are the same WIT type,
//     wasi:io/poll's `pollable`, so one resource tag/dispatch serves both)
//
// UDP, IP name lookup, and network error downcasts are also registered when
// their corresponding capabilities are enabled. No socket operation is
// reachable unless the caller supplies the opt-in capability in WASIConfig.
//
// # Blocking, single-shot connect/read/write model
//
// A real WASI host's start-connect/finish-connect pair is asynchronous:
// start-connect begins a non-blocking connect, and the guest is expected to
// subscribe+block on a pollable, retrying finish-connect until it stops
// reporting error-code::would-block. This package does not need that
// complexity to be correct: start-connect itself performs the real,
// blocking net.Dial synchronously (sockets.dial, injected via
// WASIConfig.Dialer/AllowTCP) and records the outcome on the tcp-socket
// node before returning -- by the time the guest later subscribes+blocks
// and calls finish-connect, the outcome is already known, so
// finish-connect never has anything to report but the final Ok/Err
// (wasiSockErrWouldBlock, though declared, is consequently never actually
// returned by this implementation). Every pollable this package mints
// (tcp-socket connect-readiness, input/output-stream data-readiness) is
// consequently always already "ready" the moment a guest can observe it --
// [method]pollable.block and the free poll() func both have nothing to
// wait for and return immediately -- and an input-stream's read performs a
// real, synchronously-blocking net.Conn.Read (so a genuine wait for data
// off the wire happens inside read itself, not a separate poll step).
// WASIConfig.Dialer's own doc calls this out as the intentional, spec-
// legal simplification for a single-threaded host with no real concurrent
// task scheduler to suspend/resume against.
//
// # Rep numbering
//
// Every rep this file mints (tcp-socket, socket-backed input/output-stream)
// comes from wasiSockets.allocRep, a single monotonic counter starting at
// wasiSockRepBase (1<<20) -- comfortably disjoint from wasi_fs.go's
// per-purpose counters (each starting at 1 or 3) and wasi.go's fixed
// wasiStdoutRep(1)/wasiStderrRep(2), so a socket-backed input-stream rep
// can never collide with an fs-backed or stdio one even though
// [method]input-stream.read/[method]output-stream.write dispatch across
// both spaces through one shared resource type (wasiInputStreamResType/
// wasiOutputStreamResType) -- see wasi_fs.go's streamRead and wasi.go's
// writeSink, both extended by this file's sockInStreamNode/outStreamNode
// fallback. network and pollable, by contrast, need no counter at all:
// both are modeled as a single stateless singleton rep (wasiNetworkRep,
// wasiPollableRep) that every mint (instance-network; every subscribe)
// hands out again -- see their own doc comments for why no per-instance
// state is needed.

// WithWASI -- see its doc), only registered when WASIConfig.AllowUDP opts

//
// # Discovery
//
// Built the same way wasi_sockets.go's TCP half originally was (see this
// file's top-of-file package doc): running testdata/real_udp.component.wasm
// (a genuine rustc wasm32-wasip2 guest built from `std::net::UdpSocket::
// bind` + `send_to` + `recv_from` + print -- confirmed to work end-to-end
// under a real `wasmtime run -S inherit-network` against a scratch Go UDP
// server before any of this implementation existed) against a host with
// wasi:sockets/tcp registered but wasi:sockets/udp deliberately left
// unregistered traps loud, one call at a time, naming exactly the sequence
// a real bind+send_to+recv_from run reaches:
//
//   - wasi:sockets/udp-create-socket.create-udp-socket
//   - wasi:sockets/udp [method]udp-socket.{start-bind,finish-bind,%stream,
//     subscribe}
//   - wasi:sockets/udp [method]outgoing-datagram-stream.{check-send,send,
//     subscribe}
//   - wasi:sockets/udp [method]incoming-datagram-stream.{receive,subscribe}
//   - wasi:io/poll [method]pollable.block (already registered by
//     wasiSocketOptions -- UDP's pollable is the exact same always-ready
//     singleton, see wasiPollableRep's doc, so no separate registration is
//     needed for it here)
//
// # Blocking, single-shot bind/send/receive model
//
// Mirrors TCP's own documented simplification (see this file's package
// doc's "Blocking, single-shot connect/read/write model" section) applied
// to UDP's own async shape: start-bind performs the real, blocking
// net.ListenPacket synchronously and records the outcome on the udp-socket
// node before returning, so finish-bind never has anything to report but
// the already-settled Ok/Err; every pollable this half mints is the same
// always-ready singleton wasiSocketOptions' TCP half already registers
// [method]pollable.block for. The one place this genuinely differs from
// TCP: udp.wit's own receive is documented to never block and never report
// would-block (an explicitly non-blocking, poll-then-retry contract) --
// incomingDatagramStream.receive's own doc explains why blocking for real
// inside receive is still the correct choice for this single-threaded host.
